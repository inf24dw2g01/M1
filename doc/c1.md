# C1 : Online Store API

## Description

This project consists of a web application to manage an online store, with user, product, and order management. The application was developed using a REST architecture, leveraging Node.js, Express, Docker, MySQL, and Google OAuth2 authentication as the main technologies.

It supports CRUD operations with user authentication via Google OAuth2 and differentiated roles between admins and regular users, as well as efficient management of products and orders.

## Main Features

- Creation, editing, and deletion of products (admins only).

- Product viewing available to all users.

- Creation and deletion of orders (admins only).

- Order viewing available to all users.

This project demonstrates the practical application of the contents of the Web Development II course, showcasing access control implementation with secure authentication and efficient resource management in a real application.
