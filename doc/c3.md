# C3 : Product (Development Instalation And Usage)

---

## Docker Setup

This project includes Docker configuration for both the Node.js application and MySQL database.

### Prerequisites

- Docker  
- Docker Compose

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Copy the environment variables template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in desired values for .env
   ```

2. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. The API will be available at:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. API Documentation can be accessed at:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api-docs
   ```

### Stopping the Containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Data Persistence

MySQL data is persisted in a Docker volume named `mysql-data`. To completely reset the database:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## Environment Variables

Configure these in `.env`:

| Variable               | Description                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `DB_NAME`              | MySQL database name                 |
| `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`   | MySQL root password                 |
| `SESSION_SECRET`       | Secret key for session management   |
| `JWT_SECRET`           | Secret key for JWT authentication   |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`     | Client ID for Google OAuth           |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client Secret for Google OAuth       |

---

## Authentication System

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication with two access levels:

- **Regular Users:** Access to their own data  
- **Admin Users:** Full privileges to manage users and products

### Default Credentials (For Testing)

| User Type      | Email                        | Password     |
|----------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| Regular User   | Any valid email in Users table | `password123` |
| Admin User     | Any valid admin email          | `admin123`    |

### Authentication Header

Include in protected requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

## Authentication Flow

1. **Register or Login:**

   - `/auth/register` to create a new account  
   - `/auth/login` to receive JWT token  
   - Or use Google OAuth via `/auth/google`

2. **Use the JWT Token:**

   - Include in Authorization header for all protected requests  
   - Format: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN`

3. **Authorization Levels:**

   - Regular users manage their own orders and view products  
   - Admin users have full access including user and product management

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Description                                               |

| 401         | Unauthorized - No or invalid token                        |
| 403         | Forbidden - Insufficient privileges (admin required)     |
| 404         | Not Found - Resource does not exist                       |
| 500         | Internal Server Error                                     |

## Database Structure

### Tables

- **Users:** Stores user accounts and authentication data  
- **Products:** Catalog of products  
- **Orders:** Order headers linked to users  
- **OrderItems:** Items within each order linked to products

---

## Data Relationships

### Orders, OrderItems, and Products

1. **Orders to OrderItems (One-to-Many):**

   - One order contains multiple order items  
   - Each order item belongs to one order  
   - Deleting an order cascades deletes its order items  
   - `order_id` in `OrderItems` references `Orders.id`

2. **OrderItems to Products (Many-to-One):**

   - Multiple order items can reference the same product  
   - Each order item refers to one product  
   - `product_id` in `OrderItems` references `Products.id`

3. **Orders to Users (Many-to-One):**

   - A user can place multiple orders  
   - Each order belongs to one user (`customer_id` references `Users.id`)

### Example Workflow

- A customer places an order â†’ new record in `Orders` with their user ID  
- For each product, an `OrderItem` record is created with order ID, product ID, quantity, and price at purchase  

This design enables:  
- Listing all orders for a user  
- Displaying all items in an order  
- Separating product info from orders

---

## Notes

- All authenticated endpoints require a valid JWT token  
- Admin-only endpoints require admin role  
- Regular users can access/modify only their own data  
- JWT token payload includes user role info
