# C3: ShopINF Frontend 

## Overview
This project is a simple shop user interface (UI) that connects to the backend API Of ShopInf to provide product browsing, user authentication, cart management, and order placement. It serves as the main user-facing part of the application, allowing users to interact with the shop features through a modern web interface.

## User Flow

### Regular Users
- **Landing/Home Page:** Users are greeted with a welcome page and can browse available products.
- **Authentication:** Users can register or log in using their email/password or Google account.
- **Product Browsing:** Users can view product details and add items to their cart.
- **Cart Management:** Users can view, update, or remove items in their cart.
- **Order Placement:** Users can place orders for items in their cart and view their order history.
- **Logout:** Users can log out at any time from the navigation bar.

### Admin Users
- **Admin Login:** Admins log in using their credentials or Google account.
- **Admin Dashboard:** After login, admins have access to additional pages for managing products and users.
- **Product Management:** Admins can add, edit, or delete products.
- **User Management:** Admins can view all users and manage user roles or delete users.

### Google Authentication Flow
- **Sign In with Google:** Users and admins can choose to sign in with Google from the login page.
- **OAuth Redirect:** The app redirects to Google for authentication and then back to the frontend with a token.
- **Session Handling:** The frontend stores the authentication token and user info, and updates the UI accordingly.
- **Role Detection:** If the authenticated user is an admin, admin pages become accessible; otherwise, only user pages are shown.

## How to Run the Frontend with Docker Compose

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. From the project root (where `docker-compose.yml` is located), run:
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
3. The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:4830](http://localhost:4830).

- The frontend service is defined in `docker-compose.yml` and will automatically build using the `frontend_M2/Dockerfile`.
- It will connect to the backend and other services as configured in the compose file.

## Additional Notes
- **Environment Variables:** You can configure environment variables in a `.env` file at the project root for Docker Compose, or directly in your shell for local development.
- **Static Assets:** Place images and other static files in the `public/` or `src/img/` folders as needed.
- **Customization:** Update `src/services/api.js` to point to the correct backend API URL if needed.
